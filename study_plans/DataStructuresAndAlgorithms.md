#### Methodology:
1. Solve problems according to the schedule mentioned
2. Give 20 minutes to easy questions
3. Give 40 minutes to medium questions
4. Give 60 minutes to hard questions
5. Check hints if you are not able to solve in given time
6. After that check the editorials
7. Don't waste time in single problem for the whole day
